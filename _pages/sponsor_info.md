Events like this are made possible throught support from our local community. We are asking local businesses to consider supporting the event through a monetary sponsorship or in-kind donations. In return, we will highlight your business on our Disability Community Resource Fair Facebook page, include your business on promotional materials and media advisories, and your business will be posted on a display at the event that highlights your support.  

Gold, Silver and Bronze sponsorship tiers are available. Please download the linked document above for details on tier benefits and instructions for registering. If you are unable to open and fill the word document, please contact us for an alternative format.

To all current sponsors, thank you - this event would not be happening if it were not for your generous contributions.
